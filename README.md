# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

This music/lyrics API project allows a user to enter an artist name and a song title and then display the artist information from the MusicBrainz API and their song lyrics from the Lyrics.ovh API.

Tools used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, APIs

I learned how to read nested data structures such as arrays and objects from APIs and how to style the lyrics section by using overflow-y.
